## Terraform

### Overview
- Infrastructure as code tool
- Compatible with all of the major cloud providers and projects (it means that it works with both AWS and Kubernetes resources).
- The tool works in a declarative way (same as Kubernetes), which means that I state the wanted infrastructure instead of the steps to reach there.
