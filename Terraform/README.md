## Terraform

### Overview
- Infrastructure as code tool
- Compatible with all of the major cloud providers and projects (it means that it works with both AWS and Kubernetes resources).
- The tool works in a declarative way (same as Kubernetes), which means that I state the wanted infrastructure instead of the steps to reach there.
- Terraform uses providers to manage each cloud provider.
- Terraform uses state files that represent the current state and the tool works to equivalent that with the desired state.
